ðŸ“˜ SSDT-Audio - Universal Template for AppleALC

This SSDT injects the audio layout-id directly via ACPI,
replacing the need for DeviceProperties in the config.plist.

âœ… How to use:
1. Open your machine's DSDT and find the audio path (e.g. _SB.PC00.HDAS or _SB.PCI0.HDEF)
2. Edit the SSDT-Audio.dsl file and adjust:
   - The path in External() and Scope()
   - The correct layout-id (e.g. 0x07 = 7, 0x0C = 12)
3. Compile with the command:
   iasl SSDT-Audio.dsl
4. Copy the resulting SSDT-Audio.aml to EFI/OC/ACPI (or CLOVER/ACPI/patched)
5. Enable it in config.plist â†’ ACPI â†’ Add (if using OpenCore)

ðŸŽ¯ Tip: Use Hackintool or IORegistryExplorer to verify if the injection was applied.
